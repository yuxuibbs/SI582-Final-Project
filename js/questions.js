Instead candidates came forward on the basis of regional endorsements. None of the candidates received a majority of the electoral vote, and the election was thrown to the House of Representatives.", "Like my father, I was no \"life of the party.\" I described himself as \"a man of reserved, cold, and forbidding manners.\" And I was notoriously careless about my dress, at one point wearing the same hat for ten years."],
